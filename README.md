Algerian Forest Fires Dataset Analysis and Prediction

In this project, I worked on the Algerian Forest Fires Dataset sourced from Kaggle. The goal of this project was to analyze the dataset and predict forest fire occurrences using various linear regression techniques. The key steps of this project include:

* Feature Engineering: Created and selected meaningful features to improve model performance.

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted an in-depth analysis to understand the relationships between variables and uncover patterns in the data.

* Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers to prepare the dataset for modeling.

Linear Regression Models: Implemented multiple linear regression techniques such as Elastic Net, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression to predict forest fires based on the provided features.
This project highlights the use of advanced regression techniques to improve predictive accuracy and model robustness.
